Here you will take your notes

Client-server model. The client starts the communication with the server. The second one receive a request that answer to the client.
The server connects with many clients.

if you don't have the client it's not a problem because the server can attend a client, the program doesn't crash, but if you don't have
a server, it's a problem.

types of client: any devices with processor or micro processor that can connect with a server (tablets, phones,...)
A big server can have sub-servers.

A computer can run two programmes, as a server and as a client.

Internet: the client and the server are connected by a network named internet. (Now we don't know what happened inside the internet).
In it we have some computers connected between them and they are divided in groups called networks. If we want send a message from one server computer to other
we need use that networks. IPs addy: connect with networks interface. IPs address isn't the same, depends on the network that you want contact.
